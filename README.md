Flight Delay Prediction Model<hr>
Introduction<hr>
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the project on the Flight Delay Prediction Model. In this project, we find the flight delay prediction using Machine learning and previous data.<br>

Project Objective<hr>
The primary objective of this project is to critically examine the delay of the flight. By analyzing various data on delays of flights, such as customer service automation, fraud detection algorithms, personalized financial recommendations, and more, we aim to shed light on the transformative potential of AI and the challenges it presents.

Domain: Flight Delay Prediction<hr>
Flight delay prediction models using ML provide numerous advantages to airlines, airports, and passengers by enhancing operational efficiency, reducing costs, improving safety, and ultimately enhancing the overall travel experience. These models are essential tools for the modern aviation industry as they help mitigate the negative impacts of flight delays and disruptions.<br><hr>
